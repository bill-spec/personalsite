My name is Bill Lang, this is my personal site. I'm an undergraduate at the University of Pittsburgh completing a joint degree in economics and statistics with a minor in computer science. My professional interests are in applied statistics and machine learning and this site is where I post some of my personal projects. In the future I'm looking to pursue a graduate programs in statistics, machine learning, or computational economics to further my education. Although this site started as a simple practice project I now use this as a professional nexus. Here you will find infromation about my professional experience and blogs about personal projects that I'm currently working on.
