My name is Bill Lang, this is my blogdown site. Although this site stated as a simple practice project I now use this as a professional an personal nexus. Here you will find stuff about my professional experience and personal projects that I'm currently working on. I have a seperate site for tutoring that can be accessed from the main panel.
